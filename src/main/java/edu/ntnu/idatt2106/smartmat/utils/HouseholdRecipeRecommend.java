/**
 * A class that recommends recipes for a household.
 * It uses the household's food products to recommend recipes.
 * The more food products the household has, the more recipes it will recommend.
 * The recipes are sorted by recommendation, so the first recipe is the most recommended.
 * The recommendation is based on how many ingredients the household has for the recipe.
 * The more ingredients the household has for the recipe, the higher the recommendation.
 * The recommendation is also based on how many of the ingredients the household has.
 * The recommendation also takes into account how much of the ingredients the household has planned to use.
